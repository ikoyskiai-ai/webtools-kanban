# WebTools Kanban

A modern, responsive Kanban board implementation featuring drag-and-drop functionality, dark mode support, and local storage persistence.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop**: Easily move cards between columns using SortableJS.
- **Dark Mode**: Seamlessly switch between light and dark themes.
- **Local Storage**: Your boards and cards are persisted in your browser.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Card Management**: Add, edit, and delete cards with priority levels, due dates, and custom labels.
- **Column Management**: Create new columns, rename existing ones, and delete columns with an integrated card transfer mechanism to prevent data loss.
- **Data Portability**: Export your entire board state to a JSON file and import it back to restore your data or move it between browsers.
- **Search Function**: Quickly filter cards across all columns by keyword (title, description, or labels).

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN)
- **JavaScript (ES6 Modules)**
- **SortableJS** (for drag-and-drop)

## Getting Started

No installation or build process is required. Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser to start using the board.

## Development

This is a vanilla JavaScript project. Since it uses ES6 modules and CDN-hosted dependencies, it can be run directly from the filesystem or a simple local server.

- **Styling**: All layouts are built with Tailwind CSS.
- **State**: The application state is maintained as a central object and synchronized with `localStorage`.
- **Interactions**: UI events are handled via a mix of direct listeners and custom browser events.
